An artifact details page shows all the information about a single artifact - you can only view one at a time There are often different tabs on the main part of this page to help you focus on different parts of the page. For instance there maybe an attachments tab, or a test coverage tab On the left hand side of the detail page there will be a sidebar that helps you navigate between other relevant artifacts without having to go back to the artifact list page At the top of each list page there is a toolbar with buttons to do things like save any changes, email the artifact to a teammate, or create a new artifact',\n",

By using the artifact selector on the global navigation bar you can see all the artifacts available to you for the current workspace.  To learn more about each artifact, hover over the artifact name in the artifact selector to see its tooltip If you do not see the artifacts you expect for a particular product, it may be because of your role on the product.
