A Walmart is among scores of stores looted amid two nights of protests that followed a fatal shooting Monday by police in Philadelphia.\\n\"After civil unrest earlier this week resulted in damage to several of our stores, consistent with actions we took over the summer, we asked stores to move firearms and ammunition from the sales floor to a secure location in the back of the store in an abundance of caution,\" a Walmart spokesperson said by email. \"As the current incidents have remained geographically isolated, we have made the decision to begin returning these products to the sales floor today.\"\\nThe company also removed firearms and ammo from stores in June after several of its stores were damaged in protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.\\nThe nation\\'s biggest retailer remains a major seller of guns and ammunition, although it has scaled back, selling firearms in roughly half of its 4,700 U.S. stores.\\nWalmart stopped selling ammunition that can be used in semiautomatic rifles and handguns after a 2019 shooting at one of its stores in El Paso, Texas, killed 23 people. The company stopped selling assault-style weapons in 2015 and raised the minimum age to buy firearms and ammunition to 21, from 18, in 2018. It stopped selling handguns everywhere but Alaska in 1993, and ended its sales of rifles like the AR-15 in 2015.\\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon has resisted pressure that he take his company out of the gun business altogether, saying last year that its remaining assortment of firearms will focus on hunting and sport shooting.\\nConsumer demand for firearms has jumped this year. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group, estimates there were a record 12.1 million background checks for gun purchases from January through July, up nearly 72% from 7.1 million gun checks in the year-ago period.\\nForty percent of firearms sales involves purchasers who\\'d never owned a gun, according to a NSSF survey of firearm retailers. It concludes that almost 5 million Americans bought a gun for the first time in 2020.\\nGun dealers reported a surge in firearm sales this spring as the coronavirus was spreading. \"If martial law was declared, they want to be prepared to protect their homes,\" one dealer told CBS MoneyWatch at the time. \"With this coronavirus, there is a fear of the unknown.\"\\nBefore COVID-19, firearm sales had tumbled in recent years in part because of fewer concerns among gun buyers about stricter regulation under President Donald Trump. A rash of mass shootings around the country also has driven some large companies and retailers to stop doing business with the gun industry.\\nKate Gibson is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch in New York, where she covers business and consumer finance.\\n© 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

       " 'Markets\\nHot Stocks\\nFear & Greed Index\\nLatest Market News\\nHot Stocks\\nWalmart on Tuesday announced it will reduce its gun and ammunition sales, one month after more than 20 people were killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. Walmart also pressured Congress to enact gun safety measures.\\nThe company, America’s largest retailer, said it will stop selling handgun ammunition and “short-barrel rifle ammunition,” such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber, that can also be used on assault-style weapons after selling all of its current inventory. Walmart (WMT) will also stop selling handguns in Alaska, the only state where it still sells handguns. And Walmart (WMT) will request that customers no longer openly carry guns into its 4,700 US stores, or its Sam’s Club stores, in states that allow open carry.\\n“It’s clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a memo to employees on Tuesday.\\nHowever, Walmart will continue to sell long barrel deer rifles and shotguns and much of the ammunition for those guns. The company sells guns in about 3,900 stores. Walmart will also continue to allow concealed carry by customers with permits in its stores.\\nMcMillon said Walmart’s changes were prompted by the El Paso, Texas, shooting, as well as recent mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and Midland and Odessa, Texas.\\nThe measured steps announced Tuesday are the latest changes Walmart has made to its gun policies in recent years as mass shootings continue in America.\\nWalmart attempted again to balance customers who own guns and are “part of our customer base” with safety in stores, Dan Bartlett, Walmart executive vice president of corporate affairs, said on a call with reporters.\\n“We feel like we are striking a responsible balance between the interests of law-abiding citizens who are exercising their legal rights and the safety concerns of our associates and customers,” he said.\\nWalmart represents about 2% of the market for guns today, the company said for the first time recently. Walmart believes it is not among the top three gun sellers in the industry, but it estimates it has about a 20% market share of ammunition sales.\\nOn Tuesday, McMillon said that Walmart’s changes to ammunition policies will reduce its market share from around 20% to between 6% and 9%. “We believe it will likely drift toward the lower end of that range, over time, given the combination of these changes,” he said.\\nMcMillion, who said he was a gun owner himself, took pains to avoid alienating customers.\\n“We will treat law-abiding customers with respect, and we will have a very non-confrontational approach,” he said. “Our remaining assortment will be even more focused on the needs of hunting and sport shooting enthusiasts.”\\nIn addition, McMillon said that he would send letters to the White House and congressional leaders that “call for action” on “common sense” gun safety measures. McMillon said Congress should debate re-authorizing the assault weapons ban and expand background checks.\\n“We encourage our nation’s leaders to move forward and strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger,” he said. “Congress and the administration should act. Given our decades of experience selling firearms, we are also offering to serve as a resource in the national debate on responsible gun sales.”\\nOn August 3, a Walmart in El Paso was the scene of one of the worst mass shootings in American history. Federal investigators are treating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism.\\nIn the wake of the shooting, Walmart has faced enormous pressure to remove firearms from its physical stores and criticized for selling pro-gun T-shirts on its website. Several Democratic candidates for president have called on Walmart to stop selling guns at its stores. America’s largest teachers’ union, The American Federation of Teachers, and gun safety groups have pressed the retailer to end its gun sales.\\nWalmart previously pulled displays of violent video games in its stores and also removed about 1,000 third-party items from its website.\\nDespite its history of selling hunting weapons that goes back to Walmart’s origins, Walmart has shifted its gun policies. It stopped selling assault rifles in 2015 and raised its minimum gun purchasing age to 21 last year after the Parkland, Florida, shooting. Walmart also stopped selling handguns in every state but Alaska in the mid-1990s and only sells a firearm to customers after receiving a “green light” on a background check.\\n“We understand that heritage, our deeply rooted place in America and our influence as the world’s largest retailer. And we understand the responsibility that comes with it,” McMillon said.\\n– Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the date of the El Paso, Texas, shooting.\\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

       "\"**Yes, Walmart sells firearms.**\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\nThe search results provide multiple pieces of evidence indicating that Walmart continues to sell firearms, though with several restrictions and changes over time:\\n\\n1. **Search results 1 and 2**: Both mention that Walmart discontinued the sale of modern sporting rifles (including AR-15s) and handguns (except in Alaska). They also raised the minimum age to purchase firearms and ammunition to 21 years and stopped selling certain types of ammunition. However, they continue to sell firearms meant for hunting and sport shooting.\\n\\n2. **Search results 5, 8, and 10**: These results confirm that Walmart still sells long-barrel deer rifles and shotguns and describes Walmart as a major seller of firearms and ammunition, though they have scaled back their offerings. Additionally, Walmart's CEO has stated that they aim to balance the needs of hunting and sport shooting enthusiasts with safety concerns.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the provided information, Walmart does indeed continue to sell certain types of firearms, specifically those intended for hunting and sport shooting.\\n\\n**Sources used:**\\n- Search result 1\\n- Search result 2\\n- Search result 5\\n- Search result 8\\n- Search result 10\""
